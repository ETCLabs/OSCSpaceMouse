## About this ETCLabs Project
OSCSpaceMouse is open-source software (developed by a combination of end users and ETC employees in their free time) designed to interact with Electronic Theatre Controls products. This is not official ETC software. For challenges using, integrating, compiling, or modifying this software, we encourage posting on the [Issues](https://github.com/ElectronicTheatreControlsLabs/OSCSpaceMouse/issues) page of this project. ETC Support is not familiar with this software and will not be able to assist if issues arise. (Hopefully issues won't happen, and you'll have a lot of fun with these tools and toys!)

We also welcome pull requests for bug fixes and feature additions.
